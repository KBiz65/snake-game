## Summary

The Snake Game has been the most fun thing to code yet. It was the my first time writing a game and it was a really fun experience. I was able to use HTML Canvas to draw my game board and all of it's interior components. 

The app only took about 4 days to write which is shocking to me as I had expected it to take approximately 2-3 weeks. What helped speed up the process is that I did a full white board mockup of the game and figured out in advance what order to do each step. I then focused on just writing a small piece of the game at a time. I first worked on the HTML, then worked on drawing the gameboard. I continued by just drawing one piece of the snake on the board and getting it to move around the screen. Next was working on placing the apple randomly on the screen followed by determining if the snake collided with the apple (to increase a point and draw a new apple), the side (ending the game), or itself (also ending the game).

## My Algorithm
Figuring out my alogorithm and data structure in advance really helped me move quickly on this game as well. I saw the need to hold the coordinate of the head of the snake and to only add on another coordinate if the snake ate one of the apples. I then realized I could do this easily with an array and using the .unshift method. It worked like charm!
